Hey there!

Thank you for downloading Aperturia FX Lite, and say good-bye to time consuming manual node set-ups.
This is my first ever Blender add-on—and I had a blast making it. While the core system is built as a node group (rather than a native compiled node), 
I’ve wrapped it into a full add-on for your convenience. No more appending .blend files — just install, enable, and go.

----HOW TO INSTALL THE ADD-ON:----
- Open Blender and go to Edit → Preferences → Add-ons
- Click the drop-down arrow in the top-right and choose 'Install from Disk…'
- Navigate to your downloaded Aperturia_FX_Lite.zip
- Once installed, enable the checkbox next to the add-on in the list

----ALTERNATIVE METHOD:----
- Open Blender
- Drag the Aperturia_FX_Lite.zip file into the 3D Viewport
- When the 'Install from Disk...' dialog appears, confirm it
- Then go to Edit → Preferences → Add-ons to enable it if needed
- Search for “Aperturia” to locate it quickly
- Make sure the checkbox is enabled


----HOW TO USE:----
Once installed, head over to "Compositing" and Press Shift+A or click on 'Add' > 'Group' > 'Aperturia FX Lite'. If the node does not show up immediately,
locate 'Aperturia' on the N-Panel and click on 'Restore Aperturia FX Lite' - This will add the node if it wasn't added automatically.



----FAQ:----
Do I have to re-enable it every time?
Nope. The node group is flagged with Fake User, meaning it stays in your file even if it’s not used in any node tree.
However, if the node or textures get manually deleted or purged, don’t worry—the add-on includes a failsafe system that 
checks for missing parts when you reload your .blend. Even better, you can restore everything instantly by opening the 
N-panel (press N) inside the compositor, selecting the “Aperturia” tab, and hitting the “Restore Aperturia FX” button.

What do I get from this add-on?
The add-on is meant to give you a node group that gives you a photorealistic Compositor node setup. It comes with various sliders to help you tailor the 
exact effect you wish to have.
It also has many numeral limits to avoid exaggerated values, which tend to be the "break" in the "Make or break" for photorealistic renders.

Can I edit the node group?
Absolutely. You’re free to dive in, tweak, expand, or remix it however you like. It’s made for instant realism, but you're encouraged to experiment.

If you have any more questions, you can e-mail me at radikalaa@outlook.com
or DM me on Discord: @radikal, just be sure to tell me you're there regarding the add-on, otherwise I may take you as another Discord scammer.
